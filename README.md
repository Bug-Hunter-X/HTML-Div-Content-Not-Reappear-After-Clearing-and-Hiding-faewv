This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where a div's content doesn't reappear after it's been cleared and hidden. The `myFunction()` clears the div's content, hides it, and then tries to show it again with new text. However, because the innerHTML was set to empty it does not reappear. The solution shows how to fix this issue by using a variable to restore content.
